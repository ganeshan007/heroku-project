{"_id": "doc1", "title": "", "text": "With the weather warming up and states like Florida announcing plans to reopen beaches, thoughts of beach vacations and weekends at the lake are bubbling up -- and so is the question about whether it's safe to go swimming without contracting the new coronavirus. Although infectious droplets may contaminate water and the virus has been detected in wastewater, experts agree that when it gets into large bodies of water -- like lakes, rivers and oceans -- the concentration of the virus would be so diluted that it would be difficult to contract it. While experts agree it's unlikely you will get infected with COVID-19 by recreational water activities, they did have another concern about resuming water activities: loosening social-distancing.\n\nRecreational water activities are naturally social; beaches get busy as warm weather draws crowds, friends huddle under large umbrellas and lay side-by-side on towels, and the social atmosphere lends itself to the impetus to share a beer or lemonade by the waterside. While we can feel fairly assured the water itself is safe, experts agreed many of the other activities that accompany a day at the pool or by the beach are not.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there's no evidence that people can become infected through recreational swimming, and \"the risk of COVID-19 transmission through water is expected to be low.\"\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\n\"It is extraordinarily unlikely,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, MD, professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nWe also know that tap water is safe, according to the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and that pools, hot tubs and other chlorinated water sources are not a concern because the chlorine in the water inactivates the virus by disrupting the virus' outer layer. Dr. Benjamin Gewurz, MD, PhD, infectious disease physician and associate\n chair of the Harvard Graduate Program in Virology, emphasized that the \nprimary mode of COVID-19 infection is still person-to-person \ntransmission, and the primary reason to avoid a fun weekend by the water\n would be to maintain a safe distance from others who could be infected.\n This is particularly important since people can have COVID-19 and not show any symptoms."}
{"_id": "doc2", "title": "", "text": "The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis. To date, symptomatic supportive care has been the most common treatment. It has been reported that the mechanism of COVID-19 is related to cytokine storms and subsequent immunogenic damage, especially damage to the endothelium and alveolar membrane. Vitamin C (VC), also known as L-ascorbic acid, has been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. A high dose of intravenous VC (HIVC) was proven to block several key components of cytokine storms, and HIVC showed safety and varying degrees of efficacy in clinical trials conducted on patients with bacterial-induced sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we hypothesise that HIVC could be added to the treatment of ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction related to COVID-19.Methods and analysisThe investigators designed a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial that is planned to recruit 308 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred into the intensive care unit. Participants will randomly receive HIVC diluted in sterile water or placebo for 7 days once enrolled. Patients with a history of VC allergy, end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced malignancy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will be excluded. The primary outcome is ventilation-free days within 28 observational days. This is one of the first clinical trials applying HIVC to treat COVID-19, and it will provide credible efficacy and safety data. We predict that HIVC could suppress cytokine storms caused by COVID-19, help improve pulmonary function and reduce the risk of ARDS of COVID-19.Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (identifiers: Clinical Ethical Approval No. 2020001). Findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences."}

In response, Suchomel and colleagues, who were not involved in today's study, modified the formulations by adding more ethanol or isopropanol and using less glycerol after finding that glycerol reduced their effectiveness.\n\nThe modified versions used in this study consisted of (1) 80% ethanol, 0.725% glycerol, and 0.125% hydrogen peroxide; and (2) 75% 2-propanol, 0.725% glycerol, and 0.125% hydrogen peroxide.

{"_id": "doc11", "title": "", "text": "We propose it all starts with ACE2 and its role in the kallikrein-kinin system, which to date has not been investigated in the pathogenesis of SARS or COVID-19. The kinin-kallikrein system is a zymogen system that after activation leads to the release of the nona-petide bradykinin that after binding to the B2R on endothelial cells can lead to capillary leakage and thus angioedema. The prototype diseases of local peripheral transient increased bradykinin release are hereditary or acquired angioedema (Jurado\u2010Palomo and Caballero, 2017). The clinical picture of COVID-19 is in line with a single-organ failure of the lung that is due to edema at the site of inflammation. Moreover, the presence of an elevated D-dimer without thrombosis or microangiopathy is in line with the high D-dimers in angioedema. This most likely reflects the leakage of plasma substances involved in the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin and due to kallikrein activity is processed into D-dimer and leaks back into the circulation, reflecting subendothelial activation and kallikrein activity. The ACE2 and its role in the RAAS system has been suggested to play a role for more than 10 years in the pulmonary edema due to ARDS and SARS (Imai et al., 2005). Pulmonary edema by ACE2 dysfunction was speculated to be due to increased hydrostatic pressure as a result of vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature due to high angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) (Imai et al., 2005). However, further experiments showed no difference in hydrostatic pressure and made the explanation of high angiotensin II with vasocontriction as a cause of pulmonary edema unlikely (Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005). Increased bradykinin, however, could explain this observation without increased hydrostatic pressure. Notably, the RAAS system controls vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, and the bradykinin system controls permeability and vasodilatation, whereas ACE2 regulates both.\n\nBradykinin (BK) is a linear nonapeptide that is formed by the proteolytic activity of kallikrein on kininogens (Bhoola et al., 1992). Kallikreins are serine proteases and can be divided in plasma kallikrein and tissue kallikreins (Figure 1). The plasma and tissue kallikreins release the vasoactive peptides known as kinins (all sorts of BKs) that cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and increased vascular permeability (Bhoola et al., 1992; Marceau et al., 2018). Plasma kallikrein processes high\u2010molecular\u2010weight kininogen (HMWK produced by the liver Bhoola et al., 1992) into bradykinin (BK), while tissue kallikrein processes low\u2010molecular\u2010weight kininogen (LMWK produced by the liver Bhoola et al., 1992) and results in Lys-BK (Figure 1). These are the ligands for the constitutively expressed bradykinin receptor B2 on endothelial cells (Jurado\u2010Palomo and Caballero, 2017). In addition, the enzymes (carboxypeptidase M (CPM) and carboxypeptidase N (CPN)) can further process BK and Lys-BK into des-Arg9-BK and Lys- des-Arg9-BK respectively, which are ligands for B1R, a bradykinin receptor on endothelial cells that is upregulated under proinflammatory conditions (Jurado\u2010Palomo and Caballero, 2017). These kinins have strong vasopermeable and vasodilatory capacity and need to be tightly controlled to prevent excessive angioedema. ACE and ACE2 both have roles in inactivating the ligands for the bradykinin receptors (Gralinski et al., 2018). ACE mainly inactivates bradykinin which is the major ligand for B2Rs. ACE inhibition has been linked to systemic acquired angioedema since it can result in excessive presence of bradykinin that activates B2R (Jurado\u2010Palomo and Caballero, 2017)."}
{"_id": "doc12", "title": "", "text": "Important for every epidemic are the transmission routes of the infectious agent. In relation to COVID-19  the  standard  assumption  is  that  the  following  two  transmission  routes  are  dominant:  via  large droplets (droplets/particles emitted when sneezing or coughing or talking) and via surface (fomite) contact  (hand-hand,  hand-surface  etc.).  A  third  transmission  route  that  is  gaining  more  attention from the scientific community is the faecal-oral route. The  faecal-oral  transmission  route  for  SARS-CoV-2  infections  is  implicitly  recognized  by  WHO,  see their  latest  technical  briefing  of  March  2,  2020i.  In  this  document  they  propose  as  precautionary measure to flush toilets with closed lid. Additionally, they suggest avoiding dried-out drains in floors and other sanitary devices by regularly adding water (every 3 weeks depending on climate) so that the water seal works properly. This is in line with an observation during the SARS 2002-2003 outbreak: open connections with sewage systems appeared to be a transmission route in an apartment building in Hong Kong (Amoy Garden)ii. It is known that flushing toilets are creating plumes containing droplets and droplet residue when toilets are flushed with open lids. And we know that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have  been  detected  in  stool  samples  (reported  in  recent  scientific  papers  and  by  the  Chinese authorities)iii,iv,v. In addition, a comparable incident was recently reported in an apartment complex (Mei House). Therefore, the conclusion is that the faecal-oral transmission routes can\u2019t be excluded as transmission route. Via air there are two exposure mechanismsvi,vii: 1.Close contact transmission through large droplets (> 10 microns), which are released and fall to surfaces  not  further  than  about  1-2  m  from  the  infected  person.  Droplets  are  formed  from coughing  and  sneezing  (sneezing  forms  many  more  particles  typically).  Most  of  these  large droplets fall on nearby surfaces and objects \u2013such as desks and tables. People could catch the infection by touching those contaminatedsurfaces or objects; and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. If people are standing within 1-2 meter of an infected person, they can catch it directly by breathing in droplets sneezed or coughed out or exhaled by them. 2.Airborne transmission through small particles (< 5 microns), which may stay airborne for hours and can be transported long distances. These are also generated by coughing and sneezing and talking.  Small  particles  (droplet  nuclei  or  residue)  form  from  droplets  which  evaporate  (10 microns droplets evaporate in 0.2 s) and desiccate. The size of a coronavirus particle is 80-160 nanometre2,viiiand  it  remains  active  for  many  hours  or  couple  of  days  (unless  there  is  specific cleaning)ix,x,xi. SARS-CoV-2 remains active up to 3 hours in indoor air and 2-3 days on room surfaces at  common  indoor  conditionsxii.  Such  small  virus  particles  stay  airborne  and  can  travel  long distances  carried  by  airflows  in  the  rooms  or  in  the  extract  air  ducts  of  ventilation  systems. Airborne transmission has caused infections of SARS-CoV-1 in the pastxiii,xiv. For Corona disease (COVID-19) it is likely but not yet documented. There is also no reported data or studies to rule out the possibility of the airborne-particle route. One indication for this: Corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from swabs taken from exhaust vents in rooms occupied by infected patients.

However, specifics about what this means for the immune response and how long immunity lasts are not clear.\n\nAccording to Lauren Rodda, PhD, a senior postdoctoral fellow in immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, we don\u2019t know for certain if people are immune to reinfection simply because not enough studies have been done yet.\n\n\u201cThis would require tracking the re-exposure of a significant number of people and determining if they get sick,\u201d Rodda told Healthline.\n\nKnowledge in this area continues to grow, however, as new studies are conducted.\n\nMost recently, a study published in the journal Science has found that immunity can last for as long as 8 months.\n\nAccording to Shane Crotty, PhD, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California who co-led the study, his team measured all four components of immune memory in almost 200 people who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, and recovered.\n\nThe researchers found that the four factors persisted for at least 8 months following infection with the virus.\n\nThis is important because this shows that the body can \u201cremember\u201d SARS-CoV-2. If it encounters the virus again, the memory B cells can quickly gear up and produce antibodies to fight it.\n\nThose who have recovered from COVID-19 could have immunity for months or perhaps even years, the authors said.\n\nBefore this latest study, Rodda said work had been done by her research team and others, showing that antibodies are maintained for at least 3 months.\n\nIn her team\u2019s study, in particular, it was shown that this occurs even in people who have mild symptoms.\n\nTheir study also suggested that immunity could last much longer.\n\nIn a different study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Iceland studied 1,107 people who had recovered from COVID-19 and tested positive for the antibodies.\n\nOver a 4-month period, they found that those COVID-19 antibodies did not decline.\n\nA study published in the journal Immunity found that people who recover from even mild cases of COVID-19 produce antibodies for at least 5 to 7 months and could last much longer.\n\nTheir team has tested nearly 30,000 people in Arizona since April 30, 2020, shortly after a blood test for the new coronavirus was developed."}

The controversy has been further fuelled by the fact that some of the most prestigious regulatory bodies, such as the World Health Organization, at first endorsed this claim but later walked it back, creating more confusion.\n\nIs ibuprofen safe to take if you have or believe you may have COVID-19?\n\nUntil there is more scientific evidence on this issue, patients with mild to moderate fevers should use acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra), which has been regarded as the safest drug for pain and fever for decades.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that over-the-counter drugs like Advil and Tylenol do not shorten the duration of the illness itself, but offer relief from fever and pain resulting from COVID-19.\n\nLow-grade fevers are generally harmless and a sign of the body\u2019s immune system fighting an infection. When a high fever cannot be controlled with acetaminophen (Tylenol) alone, ibuprofen (Advil) can be used along with acetaminophen and then discontinued as soon as a patient\u2019s temperature returns to normal.\n\nPeople should talk to their health care provider if they have questions or concerns about what to take.\n\nWhat is the current drug safety evidence for ibuprofen?\n\nThere are contradictory viewpoints on ibuprofen because we currently lack high-quality evidence. The only information currently available that links the use of ibuprofen to negative outcomes in COVID-19 is from scientists in China who believe that ibuprofen may increase production of an enzyme that allows COVID-19 to better bind to cells. This is purely theoretical and no clinical study has actually tested this hypothesis in COVID-19 patients who use ibuprofen.\n\nThere have also been a few anecdotal cases from French physicians. These cases are not published yet, and even if or when they are, they cannot prove a causal link as they only describe experiences of a few patients without an active comparison group to control for other variables.\n\nUntil robust studies that compare ibuprofen to acetaminophen are available, the strength of the current evidence is not strong enough to avoid ibuprofen in patients who might benefit from it.\n\nAre there any special considerations when it comes to children and ibuprofen?\n\nIt is important to lower high fevers, especially in children (38.3 C or more) as there is a two to five per cent chance of seizures in children with high fevers.\n\nChildren with viral infections including COVID-19 who have a sustained fever (38.3 C or more) might benefit from the addition of ibuprofen to acetaminophen. These patients should not be discouraged from using ibuprofen based on the current evidence. Aspirin should not be given to children for fever control due to the risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome, a rare, but serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain."}

It is unclear whether this is due to biases, confounding, misreporting, or a potential protective effect of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes. Irrespective of COVID-19, smoking is uniquely deadly.

{"_id": "doc22", "title": "", "text": "Social distancing, also called \u201cphysical distancing,\u201d means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.\n\nTo practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.\n\nSocial distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nWhy practice social distancing?\n\nCOVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you\u2014or they\u2014do not have any symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nIf you are sick with COVID-19, have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, it is important to stay home and away from other people until it is safe to be around others.\n\nCOVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home.\n\nAlthough the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community. In addition to practicing everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities.\nTips for Social Distancing\n\nWhen going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people and wear a mask to slow the spread of COVID-19. Consider the following tips for practicing social distancing when you decide to go out.\n\n    Know Before You Go: Before going out, know and follow the guidance from local public health authorities where you live.\n    Prepare for Transportation: Consider social distancing options to travel safely when running errands or commuting to and from work, whether walking, bicycling, wheelchair rolling, or using public transit, rideshares, or taxis. When using public transit, try to keep at least 6 feet from other passengers or transit operators \u2013 for example, when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a bus or train. When using rideshares or taxis, avoid pooled rides where multiple passengers are picked up, and sit in the back seat in larger vehicles so you can remain at least 6 feet away from the driver. Follow these additional tips to protect yourself while using transportation.\n    Limit Contact When Running Errands: Only visit stores selling household essentials in person when you absolutely need to, and stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household while shopping and in lines. If possible, use drive-thru, curbside pick-up, or delivery services to limit face-to-face contact with others. Maintain physical distance between yourself and delivery service providers during exchanges and wear a mask.\n    Choose Safe Social Activities:It is possible to stay socially connected with friends and family who don\u2019t live in your home by calling, using video chat, or staying connected through social media. If meeting others in person (e.g., at small outdoor gatherings, yard or driveway gathering with a small group of friends or family members), stay at least 6 feet from others who are not from your household. Follow these steps to stay safe if you will be participating in personal and social activities outside of your home.\n    Keep Distance at Events and Gatherings: It is safest to avoid crowded places and gatherings where it may be difficult to stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household. If you are in a crowded space, try to keep 6 feet of space between yourself and others at all times, and wear a mask. Masks are especially important in times when physical distancing is difficult. Pay attention to any physical guides, such as tape markings on floors or signs on walls, directing attendees to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other in lines or at other times. Allow other people 6 feet of space when you pass by them in both indoor and outdoor settings.\n    Stay Distanced While Being Active: Consider going for a walk, bike ride, or wheelchair roll in your neighborhood or in another safe location where you can maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and other pedestrians and cyclists. If you decide to visit a nearby park, trail, or recreational facility, first check for closures or restrictions. If open, consider how many other people might be there and choose a location where it will be possible to keep at least 6 feet of space between yourself and other people who are not from your household."}

{"_id": "doc25", "title": "", "text": "Until recently, many cases of re-infection with COVID-19 have been reported. However, these were considered as errors with people wrongly being told they were free of the virus after infection. In other words, a relapse of the disease was mistaken as re-infection.\n\nA 33-year-old man from HongKong was infected with Coronavirus for the second time after four months. This was the first proved case of a re-infection by Coronavirus, as Genome Sequencing confirmed that the two virus strains were different. However, the patient showed no symptoms after re-infection. This makes it a textbook case demonstrating that infection by virus produces immunity against the disease on re-infection. This means that the body had produced antibodies against the virus the first time he was infected. These antibodies prevented the appearance of any symptoms of re-infection by Coronavirus.\n\nThis demonstrates that the antibodies provide protection from COVID-19, but may not prevent getting infected again and harbouring the virus in your system. This could mean that a person recovered from COVID-19, if re-infected, can still be a source of infection for those who are not protected from the virus.\n\nExperts say that re-infection, though not impossible, is usually very rare.

WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.\n\nHerd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.

Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing on the pathogen, breaking any chains of transmission. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail. \n\nTo safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population.

Read our Q&A on vaccines and immunization for more information.\n\nThe percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known. This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors.  \n\nAchieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.

They report that one of the six treated animals showed mild breathing difficulty, whereas all six of the untreated animals showed rapid and difficult breathing. The amount of virus found in the lungs was significantly lower in the treatment group compared to the untreated group, and SARS-CoV-2 caused less damage to the lungs in treated animals than in untreated animals.\n\nThe investigators note that the data supports initiating remdesivir treatment in COVID-19 patients as early as possible to achieve maximum treatment effect.

{"_id": "doc34", "title": "", "text": "How many people have really been infected by the coronavirus? In one German town a preliminary answer is in: about 14%.\nThe municipality of Gangelt, near the border with the Netherlands, was hard hit by covid-19 after a February carnival celebration drew thousands to the town, turning it into an accidental petri dish.\nNow, after searching blood from 500 residents for antibodies to the virus, scientists at a nearby university say they have determined that one in seven have been infected and are therefore \u201cimmune.\u201d Some of those people would have had no symptoms at all.\nTheir brief report (PDF), posted online in German, has big implications for how soon that town, and the rest of the world, can come out from lockdown.\n\u201cTo me it looks like we don\u2019t yet have a large fraction of the population exposed,\u201d says Nicholas Christakis, a doctor and social science researcher at Yale University. \u201cThey had carnivals and festivals, but only 14% are positive. That means there is a lot more to go even in a hard-hit part of Germany.\u201d\nHere's why the true infection rate in a region matters: the bigger it is, the less pain still lies ahead. Eventually, when enough people are immune\u2014maybe half to three-quarters of us\u2014the virus won\u2019t be able to spread further, a concept called herd immunity. But the German town isn\u2019t close to that threshold yet, and to Christakis the preliminary figure is \u201cunfortunate\u201d because it means the virus still has more damage to do.\nThe German report is among the first to survey a population for evidence of prior infection, data that scientists need to determine how far the pandemic has spread, what the real death rate is, and how many people show no symptoms at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very preliminary, but it\u2019s the kind of study we desperately need,\u201d says Christakis, who believes the US should test as many as 200,000 people, from big cities like New York to small towns in the Midwest. \u201cThis is crucial to quantify a host of basic parameters.\u201d\nGlobally, the official case count of covid-19 is more than 1.5 million people, but that reckoning mostly includes people who seek medical help and get tested. The true number of people infected, including those without symptoms and who don\u2019t get tested, is far higher.\nMore data from \"sero-surveys\" should be available soon; sources include US hospitals. On April 6, Stanford Medicine announced it had launched its own serology test and had begun screening doctors, nurses, and others for antibodies.\n\u201cThe test will enable us to determine which health-care workers might be at low risk for working with covid-19 patients, as well as understanding disease prevalence in our communities,\u201d said spokesperson Lisa Kim.\nEarly results from hospitals are already circulating among some experts, says Christakis, who thinks these data will get us \u201ccloser to the truth\u201d about how far the infection has spread in US cities. \u201cIf you see 5% positive in your health-care workers, that means infection rates probably aren\u2019t higher than that in your city,\u201d he says.\nThe survey in Germany was carried out by virologist Hendrik Streeck and several others at the University Hospital in Bonn, who say they approached about 1,000 residents of Gangelt to give blood, have their throats swabbed, and fill out a survey.\nThey found that 2% of residents were actively infected by the coronavirus and a total of 14% had antibodies, indicating a prior infection. This group of people, they say, \u201ccan no longer be infected with SARS-CoV-2,\u201d as the virus is known to scientists.  \nAs the virus spreads, it sends a certain percentage of people to the hospital and a few of those to ICUs; a portion of those will die. One of the biggest unanswered questions is exactly what percentage of infected people the coronavirus is killing.\nFrom the result of their blood survey, the German team estimated the death rate in the municipality at 0.37% overall, a figure significantly lower than what\u2019s shown on a dashboard maintained by Johns Hopkins, where the death rate in Germany among reported cases is 2%.\nThe authors explain that the difference in the calculations boils down to how many people are actually infected but haven\u2019t been counted because they have mild or no symptoms.\nThe presence of previously infected people in the community, Streeck and colleagues believe, will reduce the speed at which the virus can move in the area. They also outline a process by which social distancing can be slowly unwound, especially given hygienic measures, like handwashing, and isolating and tracking the sick. They think if people avoid getting big doses of the virus\u2014which can happen in hospitals or via close contact with someone infected\u2014fewer people will become severely ill, \u201cwhile at the same time developing immunity\u201d that can help finally end the outbreak."}

{"_id": "doc38", "title": "", "text": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a pair of old drugs used to treat and prevent malaria, are the latest compounds to be thrust into the limelight as people tout them as treatments for the novel coronavirus. On Sunday, March 29, the US Department of Health and Human Services accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from Novartis and 1 million doses of chloroquine phosphate from Bayer. The medicines, which were donated to the Strategic National Stockpile, may be used in formal clinical trials to assess the drug's efficacy in treating COVID-19. The US Food and Drug Administration also issued an emergency use authorization allowing doctors to prescribe the donated drugs to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19 who are unable to participate in a clinical trial.\nThe moves follow the publication of studies in February and March suggest that the drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in monkey cells grown in the lab. The drugs are cheap and considered safe, although they can cause severe side effects, including heart problems. President Donald Trump touted the drugs as ready-to-go in a White House briefing on March 19, saying they \u201ccould be a game changer\u201d and that \u201ceven if things don\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\u201d\nA flurry of news about the drug followed. A man died and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested an aquarium cleaner that contained chloroquine phosphate. Demand for the drug spiked and hospitals began reporting shortages.\nA small clinical trial in France suggested that hydroxychloroquine helped patients recover from the virus faster, while another small study in Beijing reported that the drug offered no noticeable benefit. Several clinical trials, including one sponsored by the World Health Organization, are expected to put the drugs through more rigorous tests.\nOver the past decade, chloroquine has repeatedly popped up as a potential antiviral for emerging pathogens. Studies in 2004 and 2005 identified it as an inhibitor of the original SARS coronavirus. Since then, scientists have conducted several studies that used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent or reduce infections of viruses in mice, including the OC43 coronavirus, avian influenza, Ebola virus, Zika virus, MERS-CoV\u2014the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nStudies in humans have been less successful, though, and the drugs have never been approved to treat viral infections. In fact, Bayer's chloroquine phosphate, discovered in 1934 and sold as Resochin today, is not approved for any use in the US, although other companies' formulations of the drug are. Despite the lack of good evidence in humans, several drug firms, including Bayer, Novartis, and Teva Pharmaceutical, have pledged to donate millions more doses of the drugs over the coming months, while firms like Mylan announced plans to ramp up production.\nClinical trial rush\nChloroquine has a long history of treating and preventing malaria, which is caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. Today, its chemically-modified counterpart, hydroxychloroquine, is considered less toxic and is more widely used.\nIn February, a team of scientists from China\u2019s State Key Laboratory of Virology in Wuhan and its National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug in Beijing showed that low micromolar doses of chloroquine and remdesivir were effective at inhibiting the virus in African green monkey kidney cells, which are often used in virology studies. In a follow-up study, the scientists found that hydroxychloroquine was also effective, although slightly less potent, at inhibiting the virus. Another team found that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine in the monkey cells.\nChinese scientists have been quick to act on these studies. The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry lists more than 20 trials using the drugs to treat people with COVID-19, although several of these trials have already been canceled as the virus wanes in China. Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 are planned or underway in England, France, Norway, Spain, Thailand, and the US.\nA team of researchers led by Didier Raoult at France\u2019s IHU M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection published a small study on March 20 suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin could pack a powerful punch against the virus. Hydroxychloroquine treatment alone appeared to eliminate the virus in 14 out of 20 people who received the drug for 6 days, compared to only 2 out of 16 people in the control group. Six people who received hydroxychloroquine also got azithromycin, and all of them were deemed \u201cvirologically cured\u201d within 6 days. Trump cited the study on Twitter on March 21, saying that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together have \u201ca real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\u201d\nBut scientists are quick to point out several caveats. For starters, the study was small and open label, meaning the doctors knew who was getting the drugs. The clinicians only swabbed for the virus in the nasopharynx, an opening behind the nasal cavity and above the throat, meaning the virus could still be in the lungs or elsewhere in the body. Furthermore, six people who received hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t stay in the study: one left the hospital after 3 days, one quit taking the drug because of nausea, three were transferred to an intensive care unit, and one died. Preliminary results from a small study in Shanghai also rained on the hydroxychloroquine parade. After 7 days of standard medical care plus hydroxychloroquine, 14 out of 15 COVID-19 patients appeared to be virus-free, while 13 out of 15 people in the control group who only received standard care were also virus-free. The team concluded that the \u201cprognosis of common COVID-19 patients is good\u201d\u2014with or without hydroxychloroquine.\n\u201cThese potentially conflicting results reflect the limitations of non-blinded, very small clinical studies using regimens that were developed from limited data,\u201d says Peter Madrid, a researcher at the nonprofit R&D firm SRI International. \u201cThere is a reason why the clinical testing of drugs is done using randomized, double-blind, statistically powered clinical trials. It is very easy to get excited, and fooled, by small, potentially biased studies.\u201d\nOther scientists have a more optimistic view of the two clinical trials. Roberto Cauda, an infectious disease scientist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, says there are \u201cremarkable differences between the two studies that could explain the different results.\u201d The Chinese study gave patients 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day for 5 days, and the French study gave patients 600 mg of the drug per day for 10 days, he notes. The addition of azithromycin in the French study may have prevented additional respiratory infections, and there may have been a synergistic effect with the two drugs, Cauda adds.\nAndrea Savarino, a virologist at the Italian National Institute of Health, agrees that the discrepancy in dosing is important. \u201cAlthough both studies have their own limitations and very limited statistical power,\u201d he says, \u201cat present there is no reason why we should not trust the preliminary results reported by either of them.\u201d\nMultiple studies of the drugs are either planned or underway in the US. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state had acquired 10,000 doses of Zithromax (Pfizer\u2019s brand-name azithromycin), 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, and 750,000 doses of chloroquine. Cuomo said trials of the drugs will begin on March 24.\nThe World Health Organization is sponsoring a large international clinical trial called SOLIDARITY to study six drugs that could be rapidly deployed for the fight the coronavirus, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine."}

{"_id": "doc53", "title": "", "text": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a pair of old drugs used to treat and prevent malaria, are the latest compounds to be thrust into the limelight as people tout them as treatments for the novel coronavirus. On Sunday, March 29, the US Department of Health and Human Services accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from Novartis and 1 million doses of chloroquine phosphate from Bayer. The medicines, which were donated to the Strategic National Stockpile, may be used in formal clinical trials to assess the drug's efficacy in treating COVID-19. The US Food and Drug Administration also issued an emergency use authorization allowing doctors to prescribe the donated drugs to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19 who are unable to participate in a clinical trial. The moves follow the publication of studies in February and March suggest that the drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in monkey cells grown in the lab. The drugs are cheap and considered safe, although they can cause severe side effects, including heart problems. President Donald Trump touted the drugs as ready-to-go in a White House briefing on March 19, saying they \u201ccould be a game changer\u201d and that \u201ceven if things don\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\u201d A flurry of news about the drug followed. A man died and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested an aquarium cleaner that contained chloroquine phosphate. Demand for the drug spiked and hospitals began reporting shortages. A small clinical trial in France suggested that hydroxychloroquine helped patients recover from the virus faster, while another small study in Beijing reported that the drug offered no noticeable benefit. Several clinical trials, including one sponsored by the World Health Organization, are expected to put the drugs through more rigorous tests. Over the past decade, chloroquine has repeatedly popped up as a potential antiviral for emerging pathogens. Studies in 2004 and 2005 identified it as an inhibitor of the original SARS coronavirus. Since then, scientists have conducted several studies that used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent or reduce infections of viruses in mice, including the OC43 coronavirus, avian influenza, Ebola virus, Zika virus, MERS-CoV\u2014the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome. Studies in humans have been less successful, though, and the drugs have never been approved to treat viral infections. In fact, Bayer's chloroquine phosphate, discovered in 1934 and sold as Resochin today, is not approved for any use in the US, although other companies' formulations of the drug are. Despite the lack of good evidence in humans, several drug firms, including Bayer, Novartis, and Teva Pharmaceutical, have pledged to donate millions more doses of the drugs over the coming months, while firms like Mylan announced plans to ramp up production. Clinical trial rush Chloroquine has a long history of treating and preventing malaria, which is caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. Today, its chemically-modified counterpart, hydroxychloroquine, is considered less toxic and is more widely used. In February, a team of scientists from China\u2019s State Key Laboratory of Virology in Wuhan and its National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug in Beijing showed that low micromolar doses of chloroquine and remdesivir were effective at inhibiting the virus in African green monkey kidney cells, which are often used in virology studies. In a follow-up study, the scientists found that hydroxychloroquine was also effective, although slightly less potent, at inhibiting the virus. Another team found that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine in the monkey cells. Chinese scientists have been quick to act on these studies. The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry lists more than 20 trials using the drugs to treat people with COVID-19, although several of these trials have already been canceled as the virus wanes in China. Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 are planned or underway in England, France, Norway, Spain, Thailand, and the US. A team of researchers led by Didier Raoult at France\u2019s IHU M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection published a small study on March 20 suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin could pack a powerful punch against the virus. Hydroxychloroquine treatment alone appeared to eliminate the virus in 14 out of 20 people who received the drug for 6 days, compared to only 2 out of 16 people in the control group. Six people who received hydroxychloroquine also got azithromycin, and all of them were deemed \u201cvirologically cured\u201d within 6 days. Trump cited the study on Twitter on March 21, saying that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together have \u201ca real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\u201d But scientists are quick to point out several caveats. For starters, the study was small and open label, meaning the doctors knew who was getting the drugs. The clinicians only swabbed for the virus in the nasopharynx, an opening behind the nasal cavity and above the throat, meaning the virus could still be in the lungs or elsewhere in the body. Furthermore, six people who received hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t stay in the study: one left the hospital after 3 days, one quit taking the drug because of nausea, three were transferred to an intensive care unit, and one died. Preliminary results from a small study in Shanghai also rained on the hydroxychloroquine parade. After 7 days of standard medical care plus hydroxychloroquine, 14 out of 15 COVID-19 patients appeared to be virus-free, while 13 out of 15 people in the control group who only received standard care were also virus-free. The team concluded that the \u201cprognosis of common COVID-19 patients is good\u201d\u2014with or without hydroxychloroquine. \u201cThese potentially conflicting results reflect the limitations of non-blinded, very small clinical studies using regimens that were developed from limited data,\u201d says Peter Madrid, a researcher at the nonprofit R&D firm SRI International. \u201cThere is a reason why the clinical testing of drugs is done using randomized, double-blind, statistically powered clinical trials. It is very easy to get excited, and fooled, by small, potentially biased studies.\u201d Other scientists have a more optimistic view of the two clinical trials. Roberto Cauda, an infectious disease scientist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, says there are \u201cremarkable differences between the two studies that could explain the different results.\u201d The Chinese study gave patients 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day for 5 days, and the French study gave patients 600 mg of the drug per day for 10 days, he notes. The addition of azithromycin in the French study may have prevented additional respiratory infections, and there may have been a synergistic effect with the two drugs, Cauda adds. Andrea Savarino, a virologist at the Italian National Institute of Health, agrees that the discrepancy in dosing is important. \u201cAlthough both studies have their own limitations and very limited statistical power,\u201d he says, \u201cat present there is no reason why we should not trust the preliminary results reported by either of them.\u201d Multiple studies of the drugs are either planned or underway in the US. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state had acquired 10,000 doses of Zithromax (Pfizer\u2019s brand-name azithromycin), 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, and 750,000 doses of chloroquine. Cuomo said trials of the drugs will begin on March 24. The World Health Organization is sponsoring a large international clinical trial called SOLIDARITY to study six drugs that could be rapidly deployed for the fight the coronavirus, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine."}

{"_id": "doc64", "title": "", "text": "Antiretrovirals drugs were initially considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19 based on virtual screening and in vitro studies. Published data indicate that most of patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, have good clinical outcomes and do not require hospitalization. In some cases, patients admitted to the hospital were given an antiretroviral drug, most often lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r) or, less frequently, darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r). Studies assessing the potential benefit of an antiretroviral drug on COVID-19 were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.\n\nA systematic review on use of antiretrovirals in patients with coronaviruses, conducted in March 2020 identified two randomized trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID\u201019, SARS and MERS [16]. The randomized trials showed no clinical benefit, the observational studies were inconclusive, and the certainty of the body of evidence across all important outcomes was low or very low quality. A living systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for COVID-19 published in September 2020 did not find any convincing evidence that antiretrovirals drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the mortality or increased the rate of viral clearance [17].\n\nMore recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn't support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\n\nA recently published clinical trial showed that in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, LPV/r was not associated with reductions in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death [18].  Similarly, in the WHO-coordinated Solidarity Trial recently published, LPV/r appears to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. [19].\n\nBased on available evidence, the use of LPV/r and other antiretrovirals are not likely to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.\n\nSeveral randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2."}

{"_id": "doc75", "title": "", "text": "As Dr. Michael Joyner, professor, Mayo Clinic, explains on the institution\u2019s website: People who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies to the disease in their blood. Doctors call this convalescent plasma. Researchers hope that convalescent plasma can be given to people with severe COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus. The blood \u2014 about 800 ml or so \u2014 is collected from the donor through the regular withdrawal process, tested for other pathogens, and if safe, the plasma component is extracted and subsequently used for transfusion on to patients. Everyone who has suffered from a disease possibly carries what are called neutralising antibodies that when extracted via plasma and transfused on to others with the infection can help their immune system fight it off. Whether it works or not depends on whether the disease produced a lot of antibodies in people or not, explains Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, infectious diseases consultant and medical director, infection prevention and control, Mayo Clinic, U.S. For some diseases, the body needs more cellular immunity to fight the infection, while for others, the body needs more antibodies. Most diseases, however, require a combination of both these mechanisms, Dr. Sampathkumar points out. Since trials are going on, there is no standardised protocol on how much of convalescent plasma or how often it must be used. Even before we knew what sort of antibody levels have to be administered, doctors began using this technique because there did not seem to be anything else that worked. The understanding why some people have more antibodies and some have less, whether those who were asymptomatic have antibodies at all, and in what strength, are issues that will have to be answered over the course of the trials."}

When the RNA polymerase picks up the drug instead, the RNA assembly line is jammed and viral replication soon halted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an immediate stop,\u201d said Yang, because the virus has a powerful proofreading function that it will use to try to undo the mistake. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be able to fix it, and replication will stop,\u201d said Yang.\n\nWhen tested in infected cells in the lab, remdesivir stops replication in a range of viruses, including hepatitis, Ebola and other human coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS. But the drug was shelved by Gilead Sciences, its manufacturer, after trials in Ebola patients found it to be less effective than other Ebola therapies. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, researchers pulled the drug out of the freezer and found that it also stops replication of SARS-CoV-2.

(The epidemic had waned in Wuhan and fewer sick patients were available at the time of the trial.) It\u2019s unclear whether the patients also received traditional Chinese medicine, which often contain steroids that may have affected the outcomes, said Chin-Hong.\n\n\u201cSo the big picture for me, apart from it being underpowered statistically, was that this trial may not be quite generalizable to what is done in other parts of the world, including the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nMore promising results come from a large National Institutes of Health (NIH) study that enrolled over 1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients across 22 countries.

But some who catch the new coronavirus get severe pneumonia in both lungs.

They may fill up with so much fluid and pus that it\u2019s hard to breathe. You may have severe shortness of breath, a cough, a fever, chest pain, chills, or fatigue.\nYour doctor might recommend cough medicine and pain relievers that reduce fever. In the most serious cases, you may need to go to the hospital for help breathing with a machine called a ventilator.\nYou can get pneumonia as a complication of viral infections such as COVID-19 or the flu, or even a common cold. But bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms can also cause it.\nWhat is novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia?\nThe illness tied to the new coronavirus was originally called novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP).

{"_id": "doc172", "title": "", "text": "BACKGROUND Pneumonia caused by coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has spread around the world, becoming a pandemic. Many patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and mechanical ventilation, which is causing the collapse of healthcare systems in many countries. Coronavirus infection is associated with extensive lung inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, which can result in hypoxia. It can also cause severe and lasting harm in other organs, including the heart and kidneys. At present, there is no proven and efficacious treatment for this new disease. Consequently, there is a growing tendency to use novel methods. Ozone therapy consists of administration of a mixture of oxygen and ozone (a molecule consisting of 3 oxygen atoms). The potential benefits of this therapy include reduced tissue hypoxia, decreased hypercoagulability, renal and heart protection, modulated immune function, improved phagocytic function, and impaired viral replication. CASE REPORT We report rapidly improved hypoxia with associated decreases in inflammatory markers and D-dimer immediately after 1-4 sessions of oxygen-ozone (O\u2082-O\u2083) therapy in 3 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with respiratory failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation was not required in these 3 patients. All patients were discharged home on days 3-4 after O\u2082-O\u2083 therapy. CONCLUSIONS O\u2082-O\u2083 therapy appears to be an effective therapy for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. Large controlled clinical trials are required to study the efficacy and safety of using O\u2082-O\u2083 therapy compared with the standard supportive case in patients with COVID-19 in terms of the need for invasive ventilation and length of hospital and intensive care unit stays.
